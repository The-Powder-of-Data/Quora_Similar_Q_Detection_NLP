# **Quora_Similar_Q_Detection_NLP**
Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similar (or the same) questions. Various questions with the same intent can cause people to spend extra time searching for the best answer to their question, and results in members answering multiple versions of the same question. Quora uses random forest to identify duplicated questions to provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.
Follow the steps outlined below to build the appropriate classifier model. 

- **What**: An NLP project to detect similar questions from posts on Quora
- **How**: Through EDA, text processing, logistic regression & neautral network approach to modeling
- **Why**: Improves overall business model, externally with a better user experiance in finding already answered questions and internally through reduced storage cost, faster response times, better targetted addes and many other factors.

This can be reflected in the types of frequent questions we see throught the EDA process. For fun I made a word cloud in the shape of two question marks which is very on brand for this project :D Shoutout to the [Andreas Mueller]("https://github.com/amueller")
